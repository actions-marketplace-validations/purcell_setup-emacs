# A Github Action that installs a specific emacs version

Uses [nix-emacs-ci](https://github.com/purcell/nix-emacs-ci) to provide binaries for a number of different Emacs versions.

See the [actions tab](https://github.com/purcell/setup-emacs) for runs of this action! :rocket:

## Usage:

After testing you can [create a v1 tag](https://github.com/actions/toolkit/blob/master/docs/action-versioning.md) to reference the stable and tested action

```yaml
uses: purcell/setup-emacs@master
with:
  version: 24.5
```
