# A Github Action that installs a specific emacs version

Uses [nix-emacs-ci](https://github.com/purcell/nix-emacs-ci) to provide binaries for a number of different Emacs versions.

Since that project uses Nix, Nix will be installed automatically if
necessary, along with the "cachix" tool which enables downloads of the
cached binaries. If you already have nix and possibly cachix
installed, the existing installations will be used.

See the [actions tab](https://github.com/purcell/setup-emacs) for runs of this action! :rocket:

## Usage:

```yaml
uses: purcell/setup-emacs@master
with:
  version: 24.5
  ```

For an example of real-life usage, see the [Actions config for
`package-lint`](https://github.com/purcell/package-lint/blob/master/.github/workflows/test.yml).
